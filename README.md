# AraWEAT: WEAT Bias Test Specifications in Arabic

AraWEAT consists of WEAT Bias test specifications in Arabic and is an extension to the multilingual XWEAT framework, which contains bias test specifications in seven languages (English, German, Spanish, Croatian, Italian, Russian, and Turkish). Our approach to creating these translations and the results of a multi-dimensional analysis of bias in Arabic corpora and embedding spaces are described in the corresponding publication: https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.wanlp-1.17/ .

XWEAT can be found here (with translation dictionaries):
